# Interview Snapshot: user-002

## Summary

This SAM described managing accounts across 8+ different tools (Salesforce, Program Manager, DPI, Jira, SharePoint, Confluence, Upslow, Dropbox, SFTP) and the resulting friction in day-to-day work. The conversation centered on building user activity reports for WellCare, Centene, and SelectHealth -- revealing that the SAM needs licensed-vs-active user data for contract negotiations but has no single place to find it. The participant articulated clear signals for account health (regular contact, responsiveness, silence as a warning) and described a weekly Monday ritual of updating every Salesforce opportunity only to still be asked the same questions by leadership. They validated the account health dashboard concept as valuable for leadership, SAMs, and sales alike.

Trigger → Context → Actions → Obstacles → Workarounds → Outcome
```

| Step | What Happened | Feeling | Tools/Process |
|------|--------------|---------|---------------|
| Trigger | Needed user activity reports for WellCare, Centene, and SelectHealth accounts | Practical, task-oriented | DPI, Metabase |
| Context | Manages accounts across 8+ different tools daily | Overwhelmed ("Oh, no... Good grief. Hang on.") | Salesforce, Program Manager, DPI, Jira, SharePoint, Confluence, Upslow, Dropbox, SFTP |
| Action 1 | Built filtered user reports together (active users, never-logged-in users, by account) | Engaged, collaborative | Metabase/DPI admin |
| Obstacle | Can't determine how many users are licensed per contract vs. how many exist in the system | Frustrated ("I need to know how many users they have registered under their contract, and I don't know how we do that") | Salesforce (contracts), DPI (users) |
| Action 2 | Updates every Salesforce opportunity every Monday with latest status for leadership | Exhausted ("it's exhausting from a Sam perspective") | Salesforce |
| Obstacle | Leadership still asks for status updates despite Monday updates | Frustrated ("I literally do this every single Monday") | Salesforce, email/Teams |
| Workaround | Maintains churn risk opportunities AND renewal notes separately in Salesforce to double-flag risks | Resigned ("there's two places that this says the exact same thing") | Salesforce |
| Action 3 | Reviewed account health dashboard prototype | Enthusiastic ("That is great... Yeah. That's excellent.") | Custom dashboard |
| Outcome | Received automated monthly email reports; agreed dashboard approach is valuable for leadership and SAMs | Positive | Metabase email subscription |

## Insights

### Pain Points

> "Salesforce, program manager, decision point insights, Jira... SharePoint, Confluence... Upslow... Dropbox... SFTP crap."
- **Type:** pain-point
- **Topics:** tool-fragmentation
- **Context:** When asked how many systems they log into, the SAM listed 8-9 tools in rapid succession with visible exasperation

> "I literally do this every single Monday. So it's hard, but I get it."
- **Type:** pain-point
- **Topics:** reporting-burden
- **Context:** Updates every Salesforce opportunity weekly, but leadership still asks for the same information

> "a leader can't go through these one by one to see what they say"
- **Type:** pain-point
- **Topics:** reporting-burden, account-health
- **Context:** Explaining why leadership can't self-serve account status from Salesforce -- too many opportunities across too many accounts

> "all I'm doing every week is giving you those notes and you're... she's managing five of me, and we all have 12, 15 accounts"
- **Type:** pain-point
- **Topics:** reporting-burden
- **Context:** Describing the scale of the status update burden -- 5 SAMs x 12-15 accounts each

> "I had a customer where we didn't send messages for an entire quarter. And no one caught it. The customer caught it."
- **Type:** pain-point
- **Topics:** account-health, churn-risk
- **Context:** Describing a major service failure that went undetected internally until the customer escalated

> "they've been asked for people to get access who already have access, so they don't even know who does and doesn't"
- **Type:** pain-point
- **Topics:** user-activity, contract-management
- **Context:** SelectHealth requesting access for users who already have accounts, showing they lack visibility into their own user base

### Needs

> "I need to know how many users they have registered under their contract, and I don't know how we do that."
- **Type:** need
- **Topics:** user-activity, contract-management
- **Context:** Needs licensed-vs-active user count per contract for renewal negotiations, but data lives in separate systems

> "I need some sort of report that can tell me."
- **Type:** need
- **Topics:** user-activity, reporting-burden
- **Context:** Needs automated user activity reporting rather than manual data gathering across systems

> "I also need to know if they are active because they have asked for who's not using this and who is."
- **Type:** need
- **Topics:** user-activity
- **Context:** Client (WellCare) specifically requesting active vs. inactive user data, which the SAM can't easily provide

### Behaviors

> "I go and update these every single Monday. I update every single opportunity that I have with what's the latest and greatest update so that leadership has it"
- **Type:** behavior
- **Topics:** reporting-burden
- **Context:** Weekly Monday ritual of updating all Salesforce opportunities with current status

> "I have in the notes here, like, at risk, met with Centene, blah blah blah. So there's that. And then on top of that, I have the churn risk opportunity."
- **Type:** behavior
- **Topics:** churn-risk, account-health
- **Context:** Maintaining duplicate risk documentation -- both in renewal notes and as separate churn risk opportunities in Salesforce

> "you can enter in risk scores on, like, where that's at"
- **Type:** behavior
- **Topics:** account-health
- **Context:** Using Salesforce risk score history feature to track account health over time

### Workarounds

> "I wanted to call it out. Like, hey. There is a churn risk for this... So there's two places that this says the exact same thing."
- **Type:** workaround
- **Topics:** churn-risk, reporting-burden
- **Context:** Duplicating churn risk documentation in both renewal opportunity notes and a separate churn risk opportunity to make sure it's visible

> "my goal is to put into their upcoming renewal... You can have 50 users. Or they pay a fee of some time to maintain 40,000 users."
- **Type:** workaround
- **Topics:** contract-management, user-activity
- **Context:** Planning to use renewal negotiations to cap unlimited user growth at SelectHealth (40,000 users with no contractual limit)

### Desires

> "Can it be community instead of Jira? Because I know plan trying to get us completely out of Jira and selfishly, I hate Jira."
- **Type:** desire
- **Topics:** tool-fragmentation
- **Context:** Strong preference for Salesforce Community over Jira for task management; wants fewer tools, not more

### Motivations

> "knowing this information... help me so I can have a conversation with them."
- **Type:** motivation
- **Topics:** user-activity, contract-management
- **Context:** User activity data isn't just internal -- it's ammunition for contract negotiations with clients

> "from a leadership perspective, your thing could be very helpful. From a Sam, there's aspects of it that would be helpful. And then for sure from sales, it would be good."
- **Type:** motivation
- **Topics:** account-health, dashboard
- **Context:** Validating the account health dashboard as valuable across three audiences: leadership, SAMs, and sales

## Opportunities

| # | Opportunity | Evidence Strength | Quote |
|---|-----------|------------------|-------|
| 1 | SAMs need a single view of account health that leadership can self-serve without asking for manual updates | Strong | "a leader can't go through these one by one... so it's just easier to ask a Sam, but it's exhausting" |
| 2 | SAMs need a way to see licensed-vs-active users per contract in one place | Strong | "I need to know how many users they have registered under their contract, and I don't know how we do that" |
| 3 | Teams need automated detection when service delivery fails (e.g., messages not sent for a quarter) | Strong | "we didn't send messages for an entire quarter. And no one caught it. The customer caught it." |
| 4 | SAMs need consolidated account data without logging into 8+ tools | Strong | Lists 8-9 tools when asked; visible exasperation |
| 5 | SAMs need a way to share user activity data with clients for joint account governance | Medium | "they've been asked for people to get access who already have access, so they don't even know who does and doesn't" |
| 6 | SAMs need automated churn risk detection based on usage signals so they can intervene early | Medium | Validated the concept of automated flags: "your thing could be very helpful" across three audiences |

## Hypothesis Tracking

| # | Hypothesis | Status | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | SAMs spend a disproportionate amount of time on manual reporting and status updates | SUPPORTED | "I literally do this every single Monday" -- updates all opportunities weekly; "all I'm doing every week is giving you those notes"; leadership still asks despite documentation |
| 2 | Account health is primarily assessed through relationship signals rather than quantitative data | SUPPORTED | Health signals described are almost entirely relational: "regular contact," "responsive," "quiet," "fidgety and weird about contracts." Quantitative data is fragmented across 8+ tools |
| 3 | Higher product usage correlates with lower churn risk | SUPPORTED | Validated when shown the dashboard concept; agreed with the MAU axis as meaningful; "to the right is larger... K." (engaged with the metric) |
| 4 | Support ticket triage gaps are invisible to SAMs until customer escalation | SUPPORTED | "we didn't send messages for an entire quarter. And no one caught it. The customer caught it." -- direct evidence of invisible service failure |

## Behavioral Observations

- **Tools mentioned:** Salesforce (opportunities, risk scores, community/cases), Program Manager, DPI (Decision Point Insights), Jira, SharePoint, Confluence, Upslow (billing), Dropbox (analytics files), SFTP, Metabase (reporting), Microsoft Teams
- **Frequency indicators:** Updates every opportunity "every single Monday"; gets status requests from leadership weekly; SelectHealth adds new users "every single week"
- **Emotional signals:** Exasperation listing tools ("Oh, no... Good grief"); exhaustion about reporting burden ("it's exhausting"); enthusiasm about the dashboard concept ("That is great... Yeah. That's excellent"); frustration about redundant asks ("I literally do this every single Monday")
- **Workaround patterns:** Duplicating churn risk in two Salesforce locations for visibility; planning contract caps as workaround for unlimited user growth; building one-off Metabase reports to answer recurring data needs
