# Interview Snapshot: user-001

## Summary

This SAM described the recent departure of their director of customer success and its impact on the team, contrasting the departed leader's punitive management style with a more supportive interim approach. The participant validated a prototype account health dashboard that plots accounts by monthly active users and renewal/churn status, confirming the core thesis that higher product usage correlates with lower churn risk. The conversation also surfaced ongoing support ticket triage failures where tickets auto-close after 5 days without proper routing, and QA constraints caused by offshore teams lacking access to production data.

## Experience Map

```
Trigger → Context → Actions → Obstacles → Workarounds → Outcome
```

| Step | What Happened | Feeling | Tools/Process |
|------|--------------|---------|---------------|
| Trigger | Director of customer success departed; team restructured | Relieved but concerned ("we still need that person") | - |
| Context | Team performance had dropped from 80%+ to 70% to plan under previous leadership | Validated ("it was part of my quarter one predictions") | Salesforce (renewals) |
| Action 1 | Shown prototype account health dashboard plotting accounts by MAU and health status | Impressed ("I cannot believe you created it... this is what the director should have built") | Custom dashboard prototype |
| Action 2 | Reviewed specific accounts (Highmark, Elevance, Medical Mutual) on the dashboard | Engaged, correcting misclassifications | Dashboard, Salesforce |
| Obstacle | Metrics don't distinguish organic churn (member population decline) from voluntary churn | Constructive ("that's their business, not like the client said we don't want you") | - |
| Action 3 | Discussed support ticket triage failures -- tickets auto-closing, improper routing | Frustrated ("no one took the steps to...") | Community (Salesforce), Jira |
| Workaround | Creating duplicate Teams threads for every support case to ensure visibility | Resigned ("I'm just gonna double up") | Microsoft Teams, Community |
| Outcome | Agreed to continue reviewing dashboard; identified Jackie and Beth as next stakeholders | Positive, forward-looking | - |

## Insights

### Pain Points

> "our meetings were, like, the tone of it was just like, you're a bad kid, problem child. You didn't write this note, and I need it this way."
- **Type:** pain-point
- **Topics:** management-style
- **Context:** Describing the departed director's approach to team meetings, which killed motivation

> "I don't think the negative tone, like, motivated anyone to, like, go above and beyond. You know? You're just like, oh, they're churning. Not gonna try to save it."
- **Type:** pain-point
- **Topics:** management-style, churn-risk
- **Context:** Linking punitive management directly to reduced effort on saving at-risk accounts

> "someone will... and I'm like, those people I could be the person and get it better triage sometimes... And I won't know about it."
- **Type:** pain-point
- **Topics:** support-triage
- **Context:** Support tickets not routed to the right people; SAM unaware of client issues

> "Mark? Does Mark know he needs to create tickets on other boards?"
- **Type:** pain-point
- **Topics:** support-triage
- **Context:** New support staff not trained on cross-board ticket routing

> "there's that rule for five days, no response on the ticket. So the... not gonna respond. Then it auto closes"
- **Type:** pain-point
- **Topics:** support-triage
- **Context:** Tickets auto-close without resolution because they weren't properly routed

### Needs

> "until there's more things structured, operationalized, I think for one person, sucks."
- **Type:** need
- **Topics:** account-health, operational-process
- **Context:** Acknowledging the account management role is too much for one person without better systems

> "I think some improvements on the triaging because I'll notice, like, someone will... and I could be the person and get it better triage sometimes."
- **Type:** need
- **Topics:** support-triage
- **Context:** Better ticket triage routing so the right people see client issues

### Behaviors

> "Kim's style is like, hey. You got a million dollars coming up. Let me know how it's going. Like, and just open floor and keeping it light."
- **Type:** behavior
- **Topics:** management-style
- **Context:** Describing the effective interim manager's approach -- supportive, outcome-focused

> "I should try to schedule, like, once you have a new release, set up time with product or even lead it yourself. Like, show them the new feature. Connect it with something they've mentioned in a meeting before. Offer trainings, send them things."
- **Type:** behavior
- **Topics:** product-usage, account-health
- **Context:** Describing proactive engagement tactics to drive product adoption and reduce churn

> "prior to her coming in, we were always hitting the 80% threshold. If not achieving 85% to plan 90%"
- **Type:** behavior
- **Topics:** account-health, churn-risk
- **Context:** Historical team performance on renewal targets before leadership change

### Workarounds

> "every case, I'm gonna create a Teams thread just so people know that it's there."
- **Type:** workaround
- **Topics:** support-triage
- **Context:** Duplicating every support case into Teams because the ticketing system doesn't ensure visibility to the right people

### Desires

> "I could be the provider scorecard's project manager. I could also do QA."
- **Type:** desire
- **Topics:** product-quality, operational-process
- **Context:** SAM volunteering to take on product/QA responsibilities because current quality assurance is inadequate

### Motivations

> "the more people are using it, the less likely you are to churn. Like, in general."
- **Type:** motivation
- **Topics:** product-usage, churn-risk
- **Context:** Validating the core hypothesis that product usage is the key leading indicator of account health

> "If it's more sticky, they've adopted it more. It meets 80% of what they need in a tool."
- **Type:** motivation
- **Topics:** product-usage, account-health
- **Context:** Explaining why usage correlates with retention -- it reflects genuine value delivery

## Opportunities

| # | Opportunity | Evidence Strength | Quote |
|---|-----------|------------------|-------|
| 1 | SAMs need a way to distinguish organic churn (member population changes) from voluntary churn (client dissatisfaction) | Strong | "that's their business... it's not like the client said we don't want you" |
| 2 | SAMs need a way to monitor support ticket status for their accounts without manually duplicating into Teams | Strong | "every case, I'm gonna create a Teams thread just so people know that it's there" |
| 3 | Account management needs a visual overview of account health that plots usage against renewal/churn status | Strong | "I cannot believe you, of all people, created it... this is what the director of customer success should have been partnering with ops to create" |
| 4 | SAMs need a way to identify which accounts have low product usage so they can proactively drive adoption | Medium | "as a Sam, there are no users are logging in. I should try to schedule, like, once you have a new release, set up time" |
| 5 | Support teams need clearer triage routing so tickets reach the right team before auto-close | Strong | "no one took the steps to... then it auto closes" |

## Hypothesis Tracking

| # | Hypothesis | Status | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | SAMs spend a disproportionate amount of time on manual reporting and status updates | MIXED | Not directly discussed in this interview, but the SAM described duplicating support cases into Teams as a workaround -- a form of redundant manual work |
| 2 | Account health is primarily assessed through relationship signals rather than quantitative data | SUPPORTED | SAM validated the dashboard concept as novel -- "I cannot believe you created it... this is what the director should have built" -- implying this quantitative view didn't exist before |
| 3 | Higher product usage correlates with lower churn risk | SUPPORTED | "the more people are using it, the less likely you are to churn" and "If it's more sticky, they've adopted it more" |
| 4 | Support ticket triage gaps are invisible to SAMs until customer escalation | SUPPORTED | "And I won't know about it" -- SAM unaware of ticket issues; Blue Shield download error was set to auto-close until SAM "caught it, changed the status" after returning from PTO |

## Behavioral Observations

- **Tools mentioned:** Salesforce (renewals/opportunities), Jira (tickets), Community (Salesforce support cases), Microsoft Teams (informal communication), DPI (Decision Point Insights -- the analytics product), prototype account health dashboard
- **Frequency indicators:** "always hitting 80% threshold" (quarterly renewals), support ticket auto-close at 5 days, team meetings (regular cadence implied)
- **Emotional signals:** Relief about leadership change ("I feel good"), frustration with support triage ("what are you doing?"), genuine enthusiasm about dashboard prototype ("this is excellent"), resignation about workarounds ("I'm just gonna double up")
- **Workaround patterns:** Duplicating support cases into Teams threads for visibility; volunteering to do QA and PM work outside their role because current processes are inadequate
