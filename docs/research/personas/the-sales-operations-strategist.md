# The Sales Operations Strategist

## Overview

The Sales Operations Strategist is a process-oriented sales professional who thinks in systems rather than individual deals. They have deep expertise in CRM configuration, pipeline stages, and sales workflows -- and they instinctively evaluate new tools through the lens of "does this fit into the existing sales process correctly?" Rather than getting excited about flashy dashboards, they ask the hard questions: who actually runs the plays, does the data flow into the right systems, and will this scale beyond a side project.

They occupy a unique position between sales execution and operations. They know Salesforce intimately -- product configurators, qualification stages, opportunity routing -- and they use this knowledge to challenge naive assumptions about who should handle what. When presented with a tool that automates upsell identification, their first instinct is not "cool, let's deploy it" but "who are we routing these leads to, and can those people actually close them?" They advocate for matching lead quality to seller capability, preferring experienced closers over generalists who are still learning the product.

This persona is pragmatic and collaborative. They validate good ideas quickly ("this is dope", "I think it's a good pipeline generation move") but immediately pivot to execution concerns: Salesforce configuration, opportunity creation workflows, and realistic seller capability. They are a critical ally for product and analytics teams building internal tools -- they won't block innovation, but they will insist it plugs into real sales processes correctly.

## Goals

1. Route qualified upsell leads to sellers who can actually close them (1/1 participants)
2. Ensure all revenue-generating activities are tracked as Salesforce opportunities from the start (1/1 participants)
3. Leverage existing customer relationships for easier expansion sales motions (1/1 participants)
4. Get product data properly configured in Salesforce (product configurators, licenses, active users) (1/1 participants)

## Frustrations

1. SAMs lack product knowledge and are overwhelmed, yet they're expected to handle upsells (1/1 participants)
2. Tools alone don't solve capability gaps -- people still need to know what they're selling (1/1 participants)
3. Upsell workflows that bypass Salesforce opportunity tracking create data and attribution problems (1/1 participants)
4. No one has systematically mined benchmarking data (Stars Compare) for lead generation despite repeated requests (1/1 participants)

## Key Quotes

> "Why don't we just hand the best leads to the best closers?"
> -- user-001, proposing specialist-driven upsells over SAM-driven approach

> "If we do spin this up and have this running, wouldn't they still run to that same issue? Are you the one going in there and, like, greasing the wheels?"
> -- user-001, questioning whether tools alone solve the SAM capability gap

> "You're going to have to eventually. It's going to have to be an opportunity anyways if it materializes into revenue for us to capture, so we might as well just make it an op."
> -- user-001, explaining why upsells must be Salesforce opportunities from the start

> "If these guys are already our customers, the whole sales motion is a lot easier because they're not a cold lead, in a sense."
> -- user-001, distinguishing expansion sales from new logo acquisition

> "I think it's a good pipeline generation move."
> -- user-001, validating automated upsell opportunity creation

## Opportunities

| # | Opportunity | Evidence Strength | Participants | Key Quote |
|---|-----------|------------------|-------------|-----------|

| 4 | Users need a way to arm sellers with product-specific talking points and competitive benchmarks | Weak | user-001 | "This is the scores where they're low. These are their competitors who are doing better than them." |
| 5 | Users need a way to mine benchmarking data for outbound lead generation | Weak | user-001 | "Have we actually mined the data and say, like, here's the people who should be taking it?" |
