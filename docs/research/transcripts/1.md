Them: Hey, man, what's going on?  
Me: What's up, dude? How are you?  
Them: Nothing much. Happy Tuesday.  
Me: Not true. Not true. Especially.  
Them: Yeah, you're right.  
Me: I see you popping around on this open community office hours all the time.  
Them: Yeah. You caught me.  
Me: That was the hardest.  
Them: It was good. Got some time to rest, recharge, ski a little. How about you?  
Me: Oh, nice. Where are you skiing?  
Them: I'm down in Montana. Or up in Montana, I should say. I'm in California right now. Yeah.  
Me: Whoa.  
Them: I wish we went to Kalispell, which is, like, on the other side of Montana. Whitefishes. That's rice.  
Me: Okay, got it, got it, got it.  
Them: Cage.  
Me: I'm looking at. Things that are. I'm trying to make this list for you, and it's not right yet, but it will be.  
Them: Oh, yes. Oh, yes.  
Me: So we had. We moved into our house, and it's, like, right next to Emily's parents. This is a couple years. This is, like, in Covid.  
Them: Oh, nice.  
Me: But across the street.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: There was this really nice set of neighbors. They're really cool, but they're older. And they had a kid who was like a junior in high school when moved in. Then he graduated. The older girls going, but basically the kid graduated, and they were like, we're going to Montana. We're going to bozeman. And the mom was, like, needing. She's like, my older daughter is probably never going to have kids.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Our younger son is. Should not be having kids right now. I need grandkids. And I was like. I was like, you got him. We need help. You want to come over?  
Them: Yeah. Yeah.  
Me: And so she was like fairy God across the street.  
Them: Run them out. Yeah. That's awesome, though.  
Me: It was great. And they're like, we're moving to Bozeman. Do you want to come visit? I was like, do not. Just one of those. Like, I'm not. Because, like, now they're, like, fancy. Or at least the husband's fancy.  
Them: Yeah, throw that out there. Yeah.  
Me: Don't be like, oh, yeah, no, sorry. I won't be in Jackson Hole that time of year. We can't. I'm like, I have nothing better to do. I will book a ticket right now if you invite me to. I can stand your nice house and, yeah, come. And so we went over there. We went in the summer and it was beautiful.  
Them: That's literally what it is. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Take the kids too. Yeah. Oh. What do you think? Yeah. In summer it's incredible.  
Me: It was amazing. It was nuts. It was so.  
Them: Do you get a chance to go to Paradise Valley right next to it, or no?  
Me: Yes. Yes. We went all the way into Yellowstone and just, like, it was. It was stunning. It was so cool.  
Them: Yeah. I went to a wedding there. I think it was two years ago, and it was just crazy, you know? Apparently John Mayer, like, lives out there. And plays at local bars.  
Me: That's what they were telling, like. Well, she's like, Glenn Close is, like, their neighbor. Like, all these, like, famous people. Bozeman's crazy. It's a micropolis. I had never heard it because the guy who, like, used to be in real estate.  
Them: Holy crap. Yeah.  
Me: It's like the fastest growing Micropolis. Whatever. But it's this crazy thing where, like. They were, like, doing this where, like, you buy a house for $750,000.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: When you buy, like, a piece of land with a house on it, you level the house immediately, and then you build a $2 million house on top of it. And then there's, like, all these, like, beautiful home, but it's like, all the, like, housing crisis problems, like, but, like, in tiny.  
Them: Yeah, exactly.  
Me: Like you're seeing crazy houses go up and there's all these restrictions and zoning laws and all this sort of stuff.  
Them: Oh, for sure.  
Me: And then. And then it's like Van Life in the Park.  
Them: Yeah. It's so gnarly.  
Me: It's, like, all white and her daughter's vandalized girl.  
Them: Yeah. Dude, it's. It's.  
Me: And so, yeah, crazy. I'm like, this dude not wearing news. Like, riding a bike without shoes is not living in that house. Like, where does this roll?  
Them: Yeah. No 100%. Every time. Yeah, and my fiance went to school there. She went to MSU back before it blew up. Like, yeah, before Covid and before everyone found out about Bozeman. And, yeah, every time we've been now, you're totally right. It's like 50 new little housing development things and then, like, a whole street. Row full of RVs and cars and people. Car, camera. It's so. It's so wild.  
Me: All right. Yeah, exactly. It's crazy. Y. Eah. And they're like. Because, I guess. Well, is that. Is that. Or is it Eastern or is it.  
Them: But it's so. It's pretty. It's eastern Montana.  
Me: Yeah, yeah, that's what. Yeah, the. I mean, they're like. You probably know it. Like, there's like a sushi place on the. Like, one back from. And then like four, four rows back, there's, like the park and that's like, that's where they are, right? They're like. Six blocks from, like, the main saloon strip. Like, I could. I could, like, picture it like, I walk there because there's only one main drag.  
Them: Yeah, I wouldn't trust it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, well, you know, like, that whole area too. It's just like, what's next? So Bozeman blew up. Then I guess Livingston, which is closer to Yellowstone's, probably gonna be next. And Butte? I don't know if you had a chance to go to Butte, but.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, we did not go there, but.  
Them: You didn't miss out. I wasn't a fan of you.  
Me: It was. Well, it's funny, too, because I used to, like. That was, like, the joke. I used to work in television, and we used, like, all these, like, broadcast TV stations, and everybody would make fun of Bozeman Butte because it was like, really? They're like. He's like, there's literally one.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah.  
Me: Light in my town. Like, he's like, in the whole town. And, like, you know, all these, like, people from Seattle are showing up, and we're like. We're like. Butte's like a strong cbs. Like, it's looking pretty good.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Viewed as. I think I saw a comment. It was like the only place in Montana where two people will just fight for absolutely no reason. Can only go down and be. That's true.  
Me: Exactly. No. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.  
Them: But, you know, I think it's gonna do turnaround, like they all will at this point. They're all gonna.  
Me: Well, no, I think. I mean, that's. And I think they kind of know it, too, because. We don't want you here. Like, we moved to Monta from you and like, we found this, like.  
Them: Yeah, watch you here.  
Me: Boss place to live, and we just didn't tell anybody. And now, like, you guys? Yeah.  
Them: Everybody knows. Freaking Yellowstone. That's. That show just, like, ruined it.  
Me: Yeah, exactly.  
Them: For some people, I guess. But. But yeah. You wanted to talk about showing.  
Me: Yeah. Let's. Let me see if I. Yeah, let me see if this is actually working right now. I think it might actually be.  
Them: Analytics products.  
Me: Yep. Sweet. Okay, cool. Let me see. If I'm going to upload, this is probably wrong. I haven't even checked. But. I will see if we can get. This to work, okay? All. Right. Let's check this. I'm putting it in. All right. Let me share screen. This is not right, but let me see if this would be helpful. Account id. So here's like, the account id, here's Apex Health Solutions, and then we need to find out. This product will be what ultimately becomes either like caps or pass or medication adherence.  
Them: Exactly. Where did you get this from? Salesforce.  
Me: All. Right. So I'm going to bring you in under.  
Them: Oh, this is from jira. Okay.  
Me: Well, it's both. So here's my side project that I've been working on in the backgrounds. And so I'm going to show you and swear you to secrecy until such time as I can at least get from. Validation from somebody that I'm not going to get fired. This will actually help. All right, so I'll tell you, I have struggled with. The Sam's in general.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: At least specifically as it relates to, like, products and, like, all the change that's going on in there and, like, hard job and, like, there's a lot of stuff being thrown at them. Like, all of the engagement ones are now in charge of analytics. Like, I train. I train all them, like, literally six times, and then like, and, like, no one there, and still every time there's a couple, it's getting better.  
Them: Still guts it.  
Me: But it's just like, it's been rough.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And somebody like, I don't have. We also don't have the best, like, easily accessible analytics in general. And then it's like, hey, I'm looking at somebody, like, I can't tell if they have CAPS or haas. Like, there's a lot of problems in general, and some of it we're trying to, like, productize. But where I want to get to.  
Them: Sure.  
Me: This is a little. Thing. Yeah, this is a little thing that I built. Strategic accounts Dashboard.  
Them: There you go.  
Me: But I basically want to.  
Them: Oh, perfect.  
Me: Kind of pull all this data in, and basically, this is probably like a scoring mechanism.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: But I don't know or how long it's going to take. But basically, it's like it pulls in JIRA data, it pulls in Salesforce data. So here's Kansas. It's just adding up all the revs. This is the tickets that are associated with it. So this is actually like the JIRA data.  
Them: This looks really cool. I like this.  
Me: So this is like all the data refreshes, the monthly refreshes. So this is like someplace where you. Because, like, they have to go to Jira and, like, I don't know, like, they have to, like, figure out where is this pulling from.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: The client analytics data, like, so the client analytics data is, like, flowing into here. And it basically just says, like, hey, here's all this with the overarching goal of basically, like, saying anything that has either, like, an upsell opportunity or renewal will, like, get them in this, like, top right box of, like, positive momentum. And then, like, you know, hey, here's like, some other things.  
Them: Yeah. Okay? Grow zone. Yeah. Downgrades, returns would be in the. In the bottom area.  
Me: And then so here, like government employee Health Association. This has a churn opportunity that has an opportunity that was like during the date timeline between 23 and then, like, A 2026. And so. This puts them in this bottom box, and at least we know.  
Them: Down.  
Me: But my overarching goal to, like, start to combine these so we can start to say like, and then basically, this momentum thing is basically, like, how many monthly active users do they have? Like, are they actually using the product? Are they getting value out of it?  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And then where I'm really going is, like, it's going to run and there's going to be a library of expansion opportunities. Like, do you have caps? It's like, you should get Haas. Like, do you have, like, do you have, like, this?  
Them: So. So literally on that point, is there a tab or area where you see what product they have and then, like, how it was set up, or is it just captured as an opportunity, like,  
Me: Right now. It just pulls in opportunities and account data, and then it basically computes those, like,  
Them: Dan. Claude is good.  
Me: Right.  
Them: Yeah, it's so good. So I see your vision. Yeah. Oh, go ahead, go ahead.  
Me: There. That's okay. But basically, what it, like, I want to. And this is, like, create Jira ticket. But basically, like, the goal is that I want it to, like, actually run. And then I want it to create a Jira, like, expansion ticket that gets assigned to a SAM that's like, hey, like, run this playbook. Like, talk to them about like talk to them about this?  
Them: Can they? Can they do that without there being an opportunity first? Like, don't you want to, instead of creating a JIRA ticket for that? If it's potentially an upsell, shouldn't it be an opportunity instead, is what I'm saying.  
Me: Yeah, like one of the. One of the two, like, and I don't know, like, which one they want to use. Like, I think, like, probably like an opportunity. The only thing. Yeah, I guess that would be, like. Is it, like, count as an opportunity if it's like.  
Them: You're going to have to eventually. So it's a great question.  
Me: This is like a push. This is a push.  
Them: You're going to. It's going to have to be an opportunity anyways if it materializes into revenue for us to capture, so we might as well just make it an op.  
Me: Yeah, that's a good point. Yeah.  
Them: And it gets in qualification so it doesn't hurt their win rates or whatever. So I see, I see your vision. So you basically this platform here will pull in what products they have, upsells and downturns and then product specific data about like the number of licenses and active users and everything in between, okay? Cool, cool.  
Me: Right. Right. And this is basically. But this is kind of, like, at least for me, that it's helpful. But, like, what I really want this to do is I really want this to be, like, a flexible tool that people can use to start, like, creating these qualification opportunities, because, like, they should, like, like, they're kind of like, deer in headlights. At least from what I've seen, it's like. I don't know.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. And why is that? So, like, they're supposed to be on the front line.  
Me: They're just, like, catching up. They're like, I don't know what the hell. I have no idea what a population health director even does, and I'm sitting in this meeting. And I'm having all these people talk at me about caps Files. I don't. I'm Googling caps. I don't know what that means. Like, apparently it's a training thing, and I think it's like, also, it was previously an implementation job, and that got like,  
Them: So it's a training thing.  
Me: Pulled away from them. But then. But then, like, nobody, like, filled the gap there.  
Them: Yeah. But here's my question for you, though, on that. If we do run this or if we do spin this up and have this running, wouldn't they still run to that same issue? Are you the one going in there and, like, greasing the wheels?  
Me: Well, no, I didn't. That's why. That's why it's like. That's why it's like arming this combination of, like, this and a cat made, but it's like. You've been assigned. You're qualifying. We have qualified this client for the Haas Upsell. This is what the so is. Go to this Confluence page.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Call this person present this deck. Once you get them to say yes, because. And then, like, also what's in here, because we actually have data from the stars. Compare tool. Be like, this is the. This is the scores where they're low. This is their benchmarks. These are their competitors who are doing better than them. Like talk about this.  
Them: I see. Yeah.  
Me: Your first presentation.  
Them: You're talking points, and you have, like, basically. Yeah, so you have a Runway of, like, presenting. You're creating an upsell, and you're basically, like, greasing the wheels.  
Me: Yeah. I feel like these are. These are the latest. Like, these are the latest case studies. This is what the HAAS is like. Present this deck. And talk about these studies.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And say like here we thought about this from you. We saw the latest stars, compare like data. We know that you guys are suffering in this area. We know it's hard. We've had success. Do you want to like. We would love to talk to you more about it.  
Them: Can you connect this to an LLM that just gives them that recommendation?  
Me: Yeah, that's what I'm doing.  
Them: Ok?  
Me: And so that's like this. This is like the UI part of it, but the other fun stuff.  
Them: Ok?  
Me: That you start to do.  
Them: Yeah, go ahead.  
Me: I don't know if you mess with N8N much.  
Them: I have when you and I were working on it. I think it's a great tool.  
Me: But basically, that's what this. That's what this all runs off of.  
Them: But were you thinking of using NAN as a trigger to create a new upsell op, like automatically, or is it going to be okay?  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. And basically, that's what the.  
Them: How do you.  
Me: So, like, even here, like, right?  
Them: How do you make sure?  
Me: All. Right. So then. Here's. Why is this. There we go. Okay. So, like, here's the one that pulls the Jira tickets. It's a web hook, so it's responding to the actual thing, but you can also set this up. To where you're adding in. LLM.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: An A1 and then whatever.  
Them: Because that's. That's what you'd have to train to tell it.  
Me: But then. And the tool is like this. You can, like, add. Yeah. Call N8N workflow tool. And so you could say here, like, pull the JIRA ticket. You could, like, pull all the Jira tickets if you want. You can.  
Them: You would have to. Can you also pull Is it just one poll, or can you pull Salesforce data as well?  
Me: No. Then you have as many tools as you want. So you could say, like, call the and I There's a. This is the Sam Cron which pulls all Salesforce data.  
Them: Okay? So this all makes sense. I think we need to start with two things if we want to actually do this. One is just mapping this out. On paper or just in an. I don't know, whatever you prefer.  
Me: Right.  
Them: And then the second is like how we want to create that UI for them. I mean. Claude did a very good MVP from what I could see, like.  
Me: No. Well, that's what I think, like, and honestly. My overarching hope is that it might be. Hey, look, if it's crazy successful and everybody wants access to this little, like, tool, like, great, yeah, we'll figure out a way to deploy it and get people access to it.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: But my other hope is that it's like, we already have enough places. Like, maybe I'll just have that on my screen. But, like, what we really need to do is, like, the whole point is that you don't actually have to look at this, just look at all the tools you're normally doing. Just like. Hey, like, here's the salesforce. Like how many of these qualified leads actually turn out? Or, like, okay, well, we need to do a better job of making these qualifications or, like, maybe doing a better job of making these opportunities because, like, Like, like, basically, like have our target rate be. Or like target metric be. Like, how many qualified leads become advanced in the next stage? And then that's sort of the goal that we keep. Going against. And I like my hope would be.  
Them: Do you mean, qualified opportunities?  
Me: Yes. Well, sorry. Yes. How many? Like, because you said the qualification, basically. Where the qualification, whatever the opportunity that we make, that doesn't count, then it progresses to the next stage where it starts to actually be like, hey, this is like, industry. Yeah.  
Them: Yeah, yeah. That's actually exactly it. Yeah. Qualification discovery.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Okay? So.  
Me: But this is, like, total side project. You're the first person I talk to about it, but I think, like, this is what I'm hoping to do because, like, I want to actually start hitting more of, like, our metrics. And then, like, I'm kind of done. I'm exhausted from the account manager. Saying, like, they have no, like, because they're like, hey, we're doing our best. But, like, the ones who know what they're doing are doing great. And then I'm worried about.  
Them: No, this is dope.  
Me: I would love to. Rather than start, like, complaining about, like, hey, the sands aren't doing right. Be like, hey, I built you a tool. I'm going to give you the exact playbooks to run. Talk to them about these upsell opportunities. They're already in Salesforce like, and just, like, give us feedback if they're doing well or not.  
Them: Here's the thing. What about bringing sales, like the analytics sales guys, Tony and Kathy instead?  
Me: Y. Eah.  
Them: Is they? Why are we making it like Sam focused with these guys?  
Me: That's a good point. Yeah, we could definitely. Yeah, we could definitely do it that way, too.  
Them: You tell me. Like those two have the most experience selling.  
Me: No, they are definitely the better. Yeah, they're definitely the best ones. And I think.  
Them: So my opinion.  
Me: Yeah, I'm actually curious. I'll be curious as to if they're like, I already know this, or like, this, like, already, like.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Well, I guess it's helpful, too, because there are they're not taking over all the accounts. And this is actually a better idea because we're coming up in February in Boston and they're already talking about other people are going to start.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Like, these are all the current client analytics customers I haven't brought in for non analytics customers. And like, where would be a good place to start? But that would be sort of like the next.  
Them: Yeah. Before we get to that step. Here's. Here's my thoughts on it. If these guys are already our customers, The whole sales motion is a lot easier because they're not a cold bleed, in a sense. You have Kathy and Tony, who are ideally, they actually know the product way more in the Sam zoo, who are like, overwhelmed and catching up.  
Me: Call.  
Them: Why don't we just hand the best leads to the best closers?  
Me: Yeah. That's a good point. Well, I think that, too. And then the other question that I had on my other side project was, do you know how much if there is anything been done with. The Stars Compare tool. I know that, like, it's kind of like we push people to it, we ask people, like, we market it, and we basically have it as, like, a lead generator, like, if they do it. But have we actually mined the data and say, like, hey, here's the people who should be taking it.  
Them: That's it? Yeah. No, we haven't. They should. I've requested something like that before.  
Me: Okay? Here. I'll at least give this to you. This is clay, which is another fun little tool. This is all for free.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: I've not messed with it, but basically what I did is I got a hold of which data. Okay, this is. I got a hold of. The stars. Compare tool. Data. And then I was able to. For everybody. Calculate. Their intra state. Basically like their performance at a national level and their performance at a state level.  
Them: Compared to each other, right? Yeah.  
Me: And then I basically just said, here's all the list. This is everybody. Where is it? Contract summary. I think I put it.  
Them: I mean, this is like a top tier list to use.  
Me: This is everybody. This is everybody who. Shoot. I can't remember which one I did it in, but anyway. It was everybody who is in the bottom. State quartile.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And then. I took out some current customers and I took out some ones that I knew as prospects. And then. I just said, like, I want to find the directors of quality. At these companies, and this is the list that popped out, and this is their emails.  
Them: Dude, this is like. I think they should make you VP of marketing. But this list. For? No, but actually, like, this list is exactly what analytics needs to be hitting.  
Me: But this is not. This is like, not. This was pretty straightforward. To generate because we did all the hard work by, like, getting all the data and then.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah, like, we got all those responses. I just don't know if anyone ever, like, follow us up with them directly.  
Me: I think there's some of it, but, like, I feel like basically we should just have this be like, I don't know how to.  
Them: And, like, whether they go down a rabbit hole.  
Me: But basically, like, yeah, I think, like, this is, like, cold outreach campaign to basically just say, like, book time with. Tony or, like, book time with, you know?  
Them: Yeah, like, I mean, almost be automated.  
Me: Totally.  
Them: But I think this is good. I mean, this is also good. On top of that. And I don't know how we can tie this in directly to what you showed me on Nan. And the lower you have, because those were existing clients. This is like a new logo, like.  
Me: This is new logo. Yeah, this is new logo. Sdr.  
Them: Yeah. Which is cool. Like, that's still more. That's still more of.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: It's just more white space for us to attack. So I know we don't have too much time. What do you need for me to help you?  
Me: I'm going to get you the list of products to people and then. Or products to accounts and then do you need anything else to make that, like. Yeah, the Salesforce account one.  
Them: We can put that in Salesforce. Product configurators. Those two are the key things. What would be nice is like any comments or details about like specific configurations or license.  
Me: Like, why the business, Medicare, Medicaid.  
Them: I think we already have that under assets anyways, but it would be like.  
Me: Okay? Well, I think they actually. And then total allowed lives.  
Them: Yeah, well, no, like, licenses, maybe.  
Me: Yeah. Licenses. Yeah, we should.  
Them: And then active users.  
Me: Yeah. We can definitely. I will get those things. Okay.  
Them: That would be. That would be the first step. And then after that, what do you want to do next?  
Me: I think I just want to get this as a field at the account level in Salesforce.  
Them: What do you want to call.  
Me: What is the portals call it? What does the portals call? Like account.  
Them: It's a product configurator.  
Me: Do they have it at the account level or is it okay?  
Them: They do.  
Me: I would just want to like that thing. And I would. Whatever they have it. Like I would want to replicate basically exactly their currency.  
Them: Just to, like, share my screen with you. You're saying. This. One sec. This list here.  
Me: Exactly. Yep. Solutions.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Yeah, exactly.  
Them: Renewal letters. Premium billing ed. Yeah, so?  
Me: It would be predict and it would be the product would be caps Haas medication adherence.  
Them: Yeah. Perfect.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Yeah. So that's what I can do for you. Okay, so that's first. What. What's the next step after that? Like, where do you want to then switch over to N8 N?  
Me: On the. Yeah. So I think. Well, actually, I think. I'm going to pass that list by Dan Reddy probably actually is he thinks still like a reasonable. Cold. Outreach person. To talk to. Why? Does. Ok? Ay, there we go.  
Them: Daniel Reddy is currently unavailable.  
Me: To. Show you something. Okay? I don't know where. Where I went. Yeah.  
Them: Yeah. I don't know what happened there.  
Me: And a ton, I think. Yeah. Next step would be. Let's. I like the idea about moving it to, like, the best closers. I want to talk to Phil Brian about it. I want to make sure that. And then I'll talk to Kathy and Tony and make sure that they have, like, the right that they're, like, on board for these sort of things. I don't know if. You felt it might actually be better, that's what I'll do. I'm going to frame it. I'm going to show it off. At the onsite in early February. And then assuming they're good with it, like, I'll be able to meet with enough people and kind of show it off. To like. I don't think it's hard to make opportunities like in Salesforce. With AI Like, I just would need you to help me make sure that we get it, like, with this mapping and this sort of, like, configuration.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah, exactly.  
Me: But that'll be the goal. It'll basically be like, hey. Let's identify upsell opportunities. And put them into the qualification stage. And. Have them be associated with the right accounts and then we'll let them decide of, like, hey, you know, is it Kathy and Tony, or is it, like, move towards. But I feel like that'll be helpful too, because, like, we're literally doing this on site training. For the salespeople. To teach them about, like, even what the hell, like, predict product line. And like is. And like, who are these customers? And I think if we could at the end say, like, hey, now we have an automated tool. That's going to take the guesswork out of, like, This is the right opportunity to present to this client. Like, hey, like, if someone's new and they're not doing well in caps. Do caps, like, right?  
Them: Here it caps to you, yeah.  
Me: Can't, like, talk to them about caps today.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And say these things.  
Them: I think it's a good pipeline generation move.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Yeah, for sure.  
Me: Okay, sweet.  
Them: Awesome, man. I'm a little bit over, but, yeah, gave me that list, and then I'll go from there.  
Me: I'm going to go through that list, and then. Yeah, we'll talk in. Yeah, early February will be the latest. Well, we'll talk between them, but that's like I. I want to get. Now, I have, like, a little deadline to get this out.  
Them: Go. Sounds good.  
Me: Sweet.  
Them: Alrighty. Catch you later.
