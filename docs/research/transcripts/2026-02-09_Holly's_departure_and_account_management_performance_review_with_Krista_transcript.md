**Other:** **[20:00:27]** Matt, did you go away?

**You:** **[20:00:33]** Hello. Sorry. Hold on one sec. Okay. Okay. Hey.

**Other:** **[20:00:50]** How you doing?

**You:** **[20:00:51]** Good. How are you?

**Other:** **[20:00:51]** It's this one. Great. Great. Great. Great.

**You:** **[20:00:56]** Did you so one was two two ones for me. Was wanna check-in how you work because I I heard heard from a bird that Holly's not out or Holly's out.

**Other:** **[20:01:08]** Let's correct. She's out. As of last Thursday.

**You:** **[20:01:14]** How are you? How are you holding up? Alright.

**Other:** **[20:01:17]** No. I got the news while I was away. Like, Jackie called me. And I was like, she was my proxy. So I was like, oh, shit. So, like, she would not call me.

**You:** **[20:01:25]** Someone someone yeah. Like, she would not call you unless something blew up.

**Other:** **[20:01:26]** So I was like, what? My clients are freaking ridiculous. I left in every like, I leave at a good spot. I'm like, I never, like, leave the reds. You know what I mean? I was like, how It's like, Norden. And then she sent me a text. She was like, Krista, you must call me right now. And I was like, oh, shit. And then she was like, Krista, we just got an email. And I was like, o m g.

**You:** **[20:01:54]** So

**Other:** **[20:01:55]** It was part of my quarter one predictions. I don't know if you know any back story, but I was just like, I don't know. I don't know how perception is with the other leaders. Like, if she plays nice and, like, is moving things forward, Like, I I the effectiveness wasn't coming across super strong, not just from, like, a personable, like, interpersonal, like, do I like working with her?

**You:** **[20:02:15]** Yeah. Right. Right. Right.

**Other:** **[20:02:17]** But I was like, I don't like, it seems like Kim is doing a lot of these, like, trying to piece together some of the things and then tackling, like, the bigger escalations, which maybe, to be fair, was just breaking up the the bandwidth of work.

**You:** **[20:02:30]** Right.

**Other:** **[20:02:31]** But then, like, with our 70% to plan quarter four, I was like, prior to her coming in, we were always hitting the 80% threshold. If not achieving 85% to plan 90% as of vertical of rev like, getting our attention. Then our renewals done. She comes in, and now we're 70%. Not saying, like,

**You:** **[20:02:55]** Right now, yeah, it's

**Other:** **[20:02:56]** she was to blame, but, like, if

**You:** **[20:02:57]** brought in right. There's, like,

**Other:** **[20:02:58]** if

**You:** **[20:02:59]** yeah.

**Other:** **[20:03:00]** if I'm a bigger, like, leader, I'm just gonna be like, what's cause and effect?

**You:** **[20:03:02]** I could try it. Yeah.

**Other:** **[20:03:05]** They were hitting 80%. You come in, and now there's a million germs?

**You:** **[20:03:09]** Right.

**Other:** **[20:03:09]** So I was just like, I know. I feel like things a little cutthroat and whether it was her her because of her or not,

**You:** **[20:03:17]** Right.

**Other:** **[20:03:19]** I feel like it was was risky. I felt like all through quarter one, it's just been like, I don't know what's gonna happen.

**You:** **[20:03:24]** Right.

**Other:** **[20:03:26]** And I feel like, yeah. But I don't know if something incidentally, like, it's never really just one thing. You know what I mean? Like, it's all unless, like, you I don't know.

**You:** **[20:03:33]** What exactly is, like well, yeah. Like,

**Other:** **[20:03:36]** Yeah.

**You:** **[20:03:37]** one thing, like, becomes the reason. There's something that become the reason, but it was like and that's kinda what I took at least in my impression that I shared it with, like, at least and then I I don't know what it does, but, like, the people I talked to are Phil and Brian. And I was like, I was concerned about account management,

**Other:** **[20:03:59]** Yeah.

**You:** **[20:04:00]** for a while. Holly came

**Other:** **[20:04:03]** Yeah. Because

**You:** **[20:04:04]** and then, like,

**Other:** **[20:04:04]** yeah, No.

**You:** **[20:04:05]** my concern did not go away. Like, it actually, like, my my concern increased, and it was, like, already high.

**Other:** **[20:04:09]** Yeah.

**You:** **[20:04:13]** And I think, like, all that I all and I don't know anything is that it was, like, I think even if you're because you are always, like, you know, the people who make these decisions are two, three steps removed.

**Other:** **[20:04:30]** Yeah.

**You:** **[20:04:31]** Seeing her, and there can be very different impression of, like, her from one on one, but it's like,

**Other:** **[20:04:35]** Yeah.

**You:** **[20:04:35]** hey. People are leaving. On her team are leaving.

**Other:** **[20:04:39]** That like, either immediately bolted to other teams

**You:** **[20:04:41]** The bad job In a bad job market.

**Other:** **[20:04:44]** Yeah. People left.

**You:** **[20:04:46]** Voluntary, like,

**Other:** **[20:04:47]** Who she picked up on.

**You:** **[20:04:49]** in a bad job market.

**Other:** **[20:04:50]** Yeah.

**You:** **[20:04:51]** It's not usual. True numbers, like,

**Other:** **[20:04:55]** Yeah.

**You:** **[20:04:57]** are bad. And then I I think

**Other:** **[20:04:59]** And, like, even in meetings, again, I think her work like, I think the role as it is now is current is currently and I said that to Kim. I was like,

**You:** **[20:05:09]** Right. Yeah.

**Other:** **[20:05:11]** until there's more things structured, operationalized,

**You:** **[20:05:14]** Right.

**Other:** **[20:05:15]** I I think for one person, sucks.

**You:** **[20:05:18]** Right.

**Other:** **[20:05:18]** But in meetings, like, even with, like, other leaders, like, she'd be multitasking. And, like, you tell and not, like, driving things forward or coming at it from, like, a directive. She'd just be like, oh, it's in their plate. Like, from my perspective, I have nothing to do. And it's like, that's not I don't know how that

**You:** **[20:05:37]** Right.

**Other:** **[20:05:38]** others perceived it. Like, I can only assume they were just like, not really present and, like, willing to learn and

**You:** **[20:05:46]** Right.

**Other:** **[20:05:47]** yeah.

**You:** **[20:05:47]** Yeah. No. I yeah. I did not, Yeah. I got that. And it I I I just was sorry that it, like, took so long, and then it's sort of like it does feel, like, a little bit, like, hey. Good thing. Like, it should not have persisted. It's not persisting anymore. But then it's, like, also, like, hey. Like, kinda like two steps.

**Other:** **[20:06:10]** Yeah. Yeah.

**You:** **[20:06:11]** Like, okay. Well, Yeah. We're not. Like, it like, we still need help.

**Other:** **[20:06:17]** Yeah. We still need that person. I don't think it can be Kim.

**You:** **[20:06:17]** Right.

**Other:** **[20:06:21]** Although, in her limited capacity, I have found to be more effective

**You:** **[20:06:26]** Right now. Yeah. Exactly.

**Other:** **[20:06:27]** Like, when I needed help,

**You:** **[20:06:27]** Right.

**Other:** **[20:06:31]** and, like, kept things like, even though we were experiencing the churns, like, our meetings were, like, the tone of it was just like, you're a bad kid, problem child. You didn't write this note, and I need it this way. And then Kim's style is like, hey. You got a million dollars coming up. Let me know how it's going. Like,

**You:** **[20:06:49]** Yeah. Yeah. Right.

**Other:** **[20:06:50]** and just open floor and keeping it, like, light. Although, like, we get it. We have to

**You:** **[20:06:51]** Right.

**Other:** **[20:06:55]** get numbers. We gotta get things to sign. But it was just, like, a completely different way

**You:** **[20:06:56]** Yeah.

**Other:** **[20:07:00]** of managing

**You:** **[20:07:01]** Right.

**Other:** **[20:07:02]** And I can't I I don't think the negative tone, like, motivated anyone to, like,

**You:** **[20:07:07]** Right. Exactly. Right. Yeah. Exactly. That

**Other:** **[20:07:09]** to go above and beyond. You know? You're just like, oh, they're they're churning.

**You:** **[20:07:10]** right. Right. What part yeah. It's one of those things you put, like, an I've been

**Other:** **[20:07:14]** Not gonna try to save it.

**You:** **[20:07:19]** different context, but what I've seen is those things are taught like, they are those are rarely are like, it's and I again, I've been in some pretty bad work environments, but usually, even in bad work environments, like, types of grading personalities are tolerated like

**Other:** **[20:07:44]** If you hear

**You:** **[20:07:45]** Right. They're yeah. Exactly. They're they're

**Other:** **[20:07:46]** You gotta there's

**You:** **[20:07:47]** correlated assuming, like, above average performance or, like you know? And that, like, it's like, alright. Like, it's not good, but it's like, okay. But it's like, as soon as the something doesn't it's like, hey. That's not, like, that's not working. And, like, are quitting and the numbers aren't where they're supposed to be. Like so it's it you kinda put a target on your back. You know, in those types of situations.

**Other:** **[20:08:11]** Yeah. Yeah. So I felt that way for a while, but then I'm like, is this just my personal, like,

**You:** **[20:08:19]** No.

**Other:** **[20:08:20]** I would love to see it change. And yeah, I put it down in my predictions. I thought it would be, like, March, like, once our fiscals went live. Like, I thought they would give it a little bit more

**You:** **[20:08:30]** Yeah.

**Other:** **[20:08:33]** time. But they promoted Beth and Jackie, and then the following two days, K. We don't need Holly anymore. We put some people in place to kind of

**You:** **[20:08:42]** Oh, so who is it? I didn't see who it so

**Other:** **[20:08:43]** Jackie is promoted. She two people report to her.

**You:** **[20:08:48]** okay.

**Other:** **[20:08:50]** Might be more now that Holly's not there, and they haven't backed

**You:** **[20:08:50]** Right.

**Other:** **[20:08:53]** obviously, backfilled the role. And then Beth McDaniel, she is new.

**You:** **[20:08:55]** Oh, yeah.

**Other:** **[20:08:56]** But she's more tenured

**You:** **[20:08:57]** Yeah.

**Other:** **[20:08:58]** Definitely, like, a bet way better. I mean, an amazing personality. So and, like,

**You:** **[20:09:00]** Yeah.

**Other:** **[20:09:04]** trying to learn, I've no I'm reporting to her. They asked me today, which is funny because, like, Holly was just just like, when she told me, she was like, I just wanna let you know because reporting changes. And then I had a meeting with Kim, and she was like, you know, like, we've had con conversations leadership wise and, like, you know, I think you're very buttoned up. You've been here a while.

**You:** **[20:09:21]** I think you're great.

**Other:** **[20:09:22]** You you can successful. Like, would you wanna be a people manager? And I was like, thank you for at least asking me because that is, like, nice. But and then I was

**You:** **[20:09:26]** I think so.

**Other:** **[20:09:31]** like, for just full transparency, like, I don't have any interest in it. I really like my life.

**You:** **[20:09:32]** Right. Yeah.

**Other:** **[20:09:36]** Now. And I speak holding that much, like, responsibility freaks me out. And I don't wanna have meetings with leaders all day. I like just meeting with clients and being an individual contributor. But I was like, I appreciate, like, it is nice to be asked

**You:** **[20:09:48]** Yeah. No. That's the difference between yeah.

**Other:** **[20:09:50]** and to be considered. But Holly was just, like, made it seem like mean, I got, like, what, meets expectations essentially for my

**You:** **[20:09:57]** Well, I think yeah. Well, I think because it was, like, and usual usual at least, I don't know. Again,

**Other:** **[20:10:04]** Different context.

**You:** **[20:10:05]** like those people tend to be paranoid. Right? And you don't like you're not interested in promoting, like, you're like, I need Chris. Like, I can't, like,

**Other:** **[20:10:14]** Yeah. Yeah.

**You:** **[20:10:15]** I can't have this promoted because, a, she's, a threat because she'd be good. And then, like, what are they gonna think of me? And then also, like, I don't usually, those people are

**Other:** **[20:10:25]** You need aces in their places.

**You:** **[20:10:26]** Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Exactly.

**Other:** **[20:10:27]** Yeah. Yeah. So I feel good. And then they had they might promote someone else. They said they might have three managers at that level, and I just told them Hala. But Hala's kind of could could be a different story now that Hala's out of the picture.

**You:** **[20:10:40]** Right.

**Other:** **[20:10:44]** But Holly was like, I'm just interested in making money. Like, I don't wanna I don't wanna be leader. I would just wanna focus on, like, renewals because that's kinda how we make

**You:** **[20:10:49]** Yeah. Right. Right.

**Other:** **[20:10:52]** we that's how we make our extra money is, like, hitting renewals.

**You:** **[20:10:53]** Yeah. Right. Exactly. No. Yeah. That makes that makes sense.

**Other:** **[20:10:59]** Yeah. So crazy crazy that occurred on my birthday. Like, I cannot

**You:** **[20:11:01]** Birthday. Oh, yeah.

**Other:** **[20:11:05]** My phone was blowing up. Like, my friends because I was visiting friends, they were like I was like,

**You:** **[20:11:11]** Because when I went out to because you were there because I went up to Boston. I was there when Monica was gone, and Brian, Monica, and I went out to dinner. And that was her last night. And we're because we're, like, we were talking about that.

**Other:** **[20:11:21]** Yes.

**You:** **[20:11:25]** And Brian told me a little bit ago, and then he's like, hold on. Let me text, like, Monica. Should text her. And he he said, like like, he texted her, and, like, as soon as he put his phone down, was like dot dot dot. Like, she was, like, right off the response back.

**Other:** **[20:11:42]** Yeah.

**You:** **[20:11:44]** So

**Other:** **[20:11:45]** It's crazy.

**You:** **[20:11:47]** yeah. It's nuts. Speaking of

**Other:** **[20:11:51]** Alice.

**You:** **[20:11:53]** and I'll I'll go No. No. I mean, it's this is all, like, hopefully, a good thing. But I have something I'm curious on your opinion on. This is totally different, totally random.

**Other:** **[20:12:00]** Okay.

**You:** **[20:12:03]** Okay. Alright. So I was when I was trying to figure out account management and because I was like, I need help. Like, I know Krista's got her stuff together, but, I don't know what the heck is going on anywhere else. And, like, I'm

**Other:** **[20:12:15]** Mhmm.

**You:** **[20:12:18]** nervous. And so I came up with something that I was like, more just, like, for DPI, but this is bay all these dots are accounts.

**Other:** **[20:12:29]** Oh,

**You:** **[20:12:30]** And so this is, like, Molina And it shows them on the perspective of, like, whether they're healthy, like, sure like, whether they have renewals, like or upsells,

**Other:** **[20:12:43]** Mhmm.

**You:** **[20:12:45]** in this top top section. If you have churns, you're in the bottom section. And then left to right is monthly active users in DPI.

**Other:** **[20:12:54]** Oh, yeah. Yeah.

**You:** **[20:12:54]** So you kinda tell, like, where people are. And then, the I also brought in so these are all the, like, opportunities that are in Salesforce. And then the work is these are all the Jira tickets across the client analytics board and the DPI or in the monthly refreshes. You could kinda see, like, what's going on, like, what is happening. And then STARZ data. So, like, where are they good, where they need help. So you kinda

**Other:** **[20:13:29]** Yeah.

**You:** **[20:13:32]** know what's going on when you're talking to them and then being able to see the breakdown, like, by contract. And see which ones are good or bad.

**Other:** **[20:13:41]** How how are the stars being? Is it just caps ratings? What is

**You:** **[20:13:46]** These are, yeah, these are basically all the I gotta figure out. These are

**Other:** **[20:13:51]** Are those their master cap score?

**You:** **[20:13:52]** these are overall these are contracts or overall ratings.

**Other:** **[20:13:53]** Mhmm.

**You:** **[20:13:57]** Then these are, like, the average of them. I think so. But I gotta figure this. I gotta figure out. How this exactly works. But, yeah, that's a good point. I should I need to figure that out. But This was and then I guess, yeah, the other thing that was going on was basically try to start to identify, like, opportunities Like, hey. Should we talk to them about Haas? Like, you know, if they don't have Haas, talk to them about Haas. If they do have Haas, like, talk about them inflection points or something else. So it's all about, like, also where we should be thinking about opportunities with them. But wanted to get your perspective from, like, just this like, a Sam perspective. Does this let me actually see. Let's see. Who Highmark actually has a chur, and this is out of the ching. So they have

**Other:** **[20:15:03]** What was the churn?

**You:** **[20:15:04]** renewal down they have downgrade.

**Other:** **[20:15:06]** Oh, yeah. Because that was based on number lives. Like, sorry. That's that's their business. Like, that's

**You:** **[20:15:13]** Right.

**Other:** **[20:15:14]** it's not like

**You:** **[20:15:15]** So this is not a this is not a really good thing. Like, they're actually doing

**Other:** **[20:15:16]** Highmark came and said I only want yeah.

**You:** **[20:15:20]** well. Like, this is not, like, okay. I'm gonna go too.

**Other:** **[20:15:23]** Oh, yeah. Yeah. I see what you're getting at. Like but

**You:** **[20:15:24]** It's like,

**Other:** **[20:15:26]** it's not like the client said we have

**You:** **[20:15:26]** do you

**Other:** **[20:15:28]** 200,000 lives, and now we only want a 100,000 of them. It's like, no. They're base population

**You:** **[20:15:34]** It's going down.

**Other:** **[20:15:35]** external outside of us is going down.

**You:** **[20:15:37]** Right.

**Other:** **[20:15:38]** So it's more like if they remove the contract or a line of business, like, that level

**You:** **[20:15:42]** That's, like, from, like, over above, like,

**Other:** **[20:15:43]** like, a downgrade, But

**You:** **[20:15:46]** like, 20% of the contract value of, like,

**Other:** **[20:15:48]** yeah,

**You:** **[20:15:50]** total overall value or thing. It's like yeah. There's there should be, like, some limiters in there.

**Other:** **[20:15:53]** Because Memorize also can go on the opposite Sometimes we get a upsell, but it's not that no one had to work really hard for that. It would

**You:** **[20:16:04]** Right. Right. Right.

**Other:** **[20:16:05]** like, it's organic, but it's not based on, like, a driver of us as a vendor. It's just they have more members now.

**You:** **[20:16:11]** Right. And then, yeah, then I have, like so then Medical Mutual of Omaha

**Other:** **[20:16:17]** Mhmm.

**You:** **[20:16:18]** of Ohio. Sorry. What do they have? They had a downgrade interesting, for twenty five, twenty six. I don't know what that one is. But I was trying to do, like, and then Geisinger and, obviously, like, these Mercy Health New England, Florida Blue, like, Providence, and Elevate like, Elevance I don't know. Do you agree with, like, them being in the, like, higher risk perspective?

**Other:** **[20:16:51]** Yeah. I feel like they're mix and match. And they'll change things on a whim. Like,

**You:** **[20:16:56]** Right.

**Other:** **[20:16:58]** if you have 10 programs now, yeah, they're gonna renew some of them, and they're gonna get rid of some, and they're gonna get new ones. Know what I mean? It's just always changing. But they're consistent for, like, I'd say within maybe, like, the sixtieth percentage of their total revenue. Like, that's pretty much always gonna renew. But some of it is pretty variable just because they'll be like,

**You:** **[20:17:19]** Right. They're all good. I like new things. Yeah.

**Other:** **[20:17:22]** no. Don't need this anymore. So they're not a risk client. Like, they they've even said, like, they could not find them platform, at least on the engagement side. It does what we do. They like it. They're gonna keep using it, but it's the programs themselves that are variable.

**You:** **[20:17:37]** Right.

**Other:** **[20:17:39]** Like, what are they gonna do this year?

**You:** **[20:17:41]** Yep. No. That that's helpful. And then I have,

**Other:** **[20:17:44]** But this is a good like, I like where you're going. I cannot believe you, of all people, created it. I mean, I can, but it's, like, not your like, this is what the director of customer success should have been partnering with with ops or someone to create.

**You:** **[20:17:55]** No. Yeah. Feel like yeah. This is this is kind of like, also, like, do you you kinda get closer and then you're like, I think I actually can, like, do some of this. And then it's also helpful because then you get to show it to people and they're like, oh, like, yeah, that makes sense or, like, that doesn't make sense.

**Other:** **[20:18:12]** Yeah.

**You:** **[20:18:14]** But I would say, like, would

**Other:** **[20:18:18]** It's hitting, like, 80% of what you need.

**You:** **[20:18:20]** Yeah. Exactly. And then I

**Other:** **[20:18:21]** If you're just thinking of DPI clients,

**You:** **[20:18:24]** well, this is basically right now because I don't have a good

**Other:** **[20:18:26]** analytics.

**You:** **[20:18:28]** I don't know if other other people might have different metrics. Like, monthly average users doesn't make sense for engagement. Like, I guess it might be, like, number of programs or something. Or, like, the quality of their programs. But because, like, I didn't have, like, a good matrix kinda, like, a two by two to, like, put them up against. And I also well, I I care most about DPI, obviously. But no.

**Other:** **[20:18:53]** Yeah.

**You:** **[20:18:54]** I care about the enterprise. But

**Other:** **[20:18:54]** I mean, although analytics

**You:** **[20:18:56]** then I

**Other:** **[20:18:57]** is a smaller amount of revenue, it is the most consistent. Like,

**You:** **[20:19:00]** Yeah. No. Exactly. And I think well, then and then I was wondering about this because do you agree with this? Like, basically, like, and I think some of the metrics reported, but, basically, the more you're the more people are using it, the less likely you are to churn. Like, in general.

**Other:** **[20:19:15]** Yes.

**You:** **[20:19:17]** And I guess the question, like,

**Other:** **[20:19:20]** If it's more sticky,

**You:** **[20:19:20]** yeah.

**Other:** **[20:19:22]** they've adopted it more. It meets

**You:** **[20:19:24]** And then that's the question of, like, hey.

**Other:** **[20:19:25]** 80% of what they need in a tool. It'll never be per like,

**You:** **[20:19:28]** No. And it's more like, how do you move

**Other:** **[20:19:29]** every time we train a call team, they're like, well, we have this system. And I'm like, we're never gonna be that system.

**You:** **[20:19:33]** Right. Exactly. Exactly.

**Other:** **[20:19:34]** Like,

**You:** **[20:19:36]** I think it's, like, just moving it. Like, how do we move people from, like, this left side over to the right side more? Like, there's always gonna be ups and downs, it'll be different path. But, like, at least now you kind of like, hey. We know

**Other:** **[20:19:49]** Yeah.

**You:** **[20:19:50]** like, this is kinda what we're shooting for.

**Other:** **[20:19:51]** Or, you know, as a Sam, there are no users are logging in. I should try to schedule, like, once

**You:** **[20:19:57]** Right. Exactly. Like,

**Other:** **[20:20:01]** you have a new release, set up time with

**You:** **[20:20:02]** right.

**Other:** **[20:20:03]** product or even leave it yourself. Like, show them the new feature.

**You:** **[20:20:06]** Exact

**Other:** **[20:20:07]** Connect it with something they've mentioned in a meeting before.

**You:** **[20:20:07]** Yeah. Right.

**Other:** **[20:20:10]** Offer trainings,

**You:** **[20:20:11]** Okay.

**Other:** **[20:20:13]** send them things. I know. Yeah. That's excellent.

**You:** **[20:20:17]** And then so who is who it's like, Jackie and Beth. Probably would be more interested in this sort of stuff you think or at least

**Other:** **[20:20:24]** Pretty yeah. In the current structure, yes.

**You:** **[20:20:29]** alright. I'll set up time with

**Other:** **[20:20:30]** They would be the ones to take it, but you can always run it by me.

**You:** **[20:20:34]** Obviously, no. Yeah. That's, exactly what I did.

**Other:** **[20:20:35]** Yeah. Because we have this meeting reoccurring.

**You:** **[20:20:38]** Exactly. Exactly. Alright. Sweet. I will go work on that, and I wonder what the the Jira synced a while ago. That's interesting. But, alright. That's what I got.

**Other:** **[20:20:52]** Yeah. Oh, also, like, you should I you saw it today on the HXI. I'm trying to train my clients on community. Like, you need to choose the right things.

**You:** **[20:21:04]** I you're doing a really good job with that.

**Other:** **[20:21:06]** Thank you. I do think some improvements on the triaging because I'll notice, like, someone will I and I'm like, those people I could be the person and get it better triage sometimes.

**You:** **[20:21:15]** Yeah. And that I know. I know. That's why I'm I'm like,

**Other:** **[20:21:19]** And I won't know about it.

**You:** **[20:21:21]** this is, like, one of the things where they're like, they took it away, and I'm like, alright. Like,

**Other:** **[20:21:21]** If you until you

**You:** **[20:21:25]** you're running it. And then,

**Other:** **[20:21:27]** Yeah. Because it's like, does what's his name?

**You:** **[20:21:31]** Mark Yeah. I know.

**Other:** **[20:21:32]** Mark? Does Mark know he needs to create tickets on other boards? Like,

**You:** **[20:21:33]** Yeah. I think I think

**Other:** **[20:21:36]** I all I see, and I'm I think he's new.

**You:** **[20:21:39]** yeah.

**Other:** **[20:21:39]** He just replies, like, to the client, like, this is being worked on.

**You:** **[20:21:42]** Right.

**Other:** **[20:21:43]** And then there's that rule for five days, no response on the ticket. So the

**You:** **[20:21:43]** Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

**Other:** **[20:21:47]** not gonna respond. Then it auto closes, and I'm like,

**You:** **[20:21:48]** What are you doing? Yeah. I know. I know. That's what

**Other:** **[20:21:50]** no one took the steps to

**You:** **[20:21:52]** I think that's what, like, Sunny yeah.

**Other:** **[20:21:53]** it needs

**You:** **[20:21:54]** I'm gonna I'll always say it to, like, Silee and because I have time with them.

**Other:** **[20:22:00]** Yeah.

**You:** **[20:22:01]** And let me say, like, hey. Alright. Hey. At Sai Lee and Sunny.

**Other:** **[20:22:06]** Maybe there's more options needed in those drop downs that then gets it

**You:** **[20:22:10]** Yeah. Wanted to

**Other:** **[20:22:11]** triaged. There's, like, DPI enhancement, DPI bug, I don't we'd have to look at previous types of tickets we used to get on the support side or at least you know, that channel we used to have, and we'd be like, issue. Issue.

**You:** **[20:22:24]** I know. Yeah. Exactly.

**Other:** **[20:22:27]** Classify them and give the the clients more drop downs.

**You:** **[20:22:29]** That's what we did. And that's what yeah. That's what but, like and then but then they're like, no. This the came in. They're like, these are the

**Other:** **[20:22:35]** Yeah. These are the works the work streams.

**You:** **[20:22:36]** you get them. Right.

**Other:** **[20:22:40]** I'm like, but not everything fits in there.

**You:** **[20:22:42]** They're like, they

**Other:** **[20:22:42]** And then simple things like a DPI user, I'm like, that's

**You:** **[20:22:43]** yeah.

**Other:** **[20:22:45]** should be three days max. I can go in and do it right now.

**You:** **[20:22:48]** I know. That's why and it's, like, it's, like, the bad thing of, like, that's when did did you put it? Or yeah. It's the chatter.

**Other:** **[20:23:00]** Yeah. So my only one right now is that

**You:** **[20:23:02]** There you go.

**Other:** **[20:23:03]** yeah. Because now I'm like, I'm just gonna double up. I'm gonna, like, every case, I'm gonna create a Teams thread just so people know

**You:** **[20:23:07]** I know. Exactly. We're

**Other:** **[20:23:10]** that it's there.

**You:** **[20:23:11]** yeah. Exactly. Seems like

**Other:** **[20:23:12]** Yeah. The

**You:** **[20:23:16]** DPI tickets are being are not being triaged properly, but then they get auto closed after five days.

**Other:** **[20:23:29]** Yeah. Like or an example because people kept asking about that, that you know, the for Blue Shield California downloading the segment, they got

**You:** **[20:23:39]** So I

**Other:** **[20:23:39]** thrown an error.

**You:** **[20:23:40]** so I I I figured

**Other:** **[20:23:41]** But that was that was set to auto close. And I just came back from PTO

**You:** **[20:23:42]** I Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I just what the what the f?

**Other:** **[20:23:45]** caught it, changed the status. Yeah.

**You:** **[20:23:49]** And that I never heard it. Like, I didn't hear about it. And I didn't so

**Other:** **[20:23:51]** Because just since, I feel like they're just, like,

**You:** **[20:23:53]** and that one

**Other:** **[20:23:56]** well,

**You:** **[20:23:56]** I'm really hoping

**Other:** **[20:23:57]** someone reaches back out.

**You:** **[20:23:57]** I we kinda also well, yeah, then it's, like, kinda lucky time You gotta take what you can get. What's he gonna say? Shoot. I was able to figure out what's going on. There was a problem with exporting for dynamic columns. That they fixed, and then I think that accidentally inadvertently broke something else. We also don't have the best QA. We don't have good QA. Like, in general, and it's like it sucks. No. It no. It's you and it's me. And then it's like, I'm and I have been like I'm like, there's a reason I have my job and not someone else's job. In QA because I'm not good at it. Like, I need help. And

**Other:** **[20:24:32]** QA is me. Or the client?

**You:** **[20:24:48]** it's we got, like, some QA person, but they're not

**Other:** **[20:24:50]** You gotta learn that it takes a while.

**You:** **[20:24:51]** It's not great. And they're they're offshore. Looking offshore, and they so they can only do it in in test. So they don't have access to staging. They don't

**Other:** **[20:25:01]** Oh, yeah. Because a lot of clients, they can't have their data.

**You:** **[20:25:03]** all the problems happen in real data.

**Other:** **[20:25:05]** In prod. But a lot of clients, Blue Shield included, they have a clause in their SOW that

**You:** **[20:25:10]** Right. Exactly.

**Other:** **[20:25:12]** no offshore folks are allowed to work on it.

**You:** **[20:25:14]** Exactly. But that's why it's because no so no offshore people have access to any PHI because

**Other:** **[20:25:15]** Yeah.

**You:** **[20:25:19]** you can't, like, delineate between and so it sucks. So yeah. Anyway,

**Other:** **[20:25:25]** You know what? Just move me over.

**You:** **[20:25:26]** it's my

**Other:** **[20:25:28]** I I think at this point, I

**You:** **[20:25:28]** it's

**Other:** **[20:25:30]** if and I would leave the Callaway Management as whole. But I could be the provider scorecard's project manager I could also do QA.

**You:** **[20:25:39]** You wanted me like, I mean, if you want to, like, there because there's, like, this whole delivery

**Other:** **[20:25:39]** In product all the time. You can match my base salary

**You:** **[20:25:45]** Yeah. There's a whole delivery org. I don't know. Do you wanna hang out with engineers though? I don't know how much

**Other:** **[20:25:50]** Yeah. Because I know you have to be very explicit with them.

**You:** **[20:25:51]** like, yeah.

**Other:** **[20:25:54]** Actually, I'd ask Keana if she thinks I interact with the engineer as well. Because I'm always like,

**You:** **[20:25:58]** I think you do because, like, a lot of it is it's having you have to be comfortable being, like, why am I the only person talking in this situation all the time? They're like, oh, yeah. We

**Other:** **[20:26:07]** Yeah.

**You:** **[20:26:08]** don't usually talk. Like yeah. So and then you have to be, yeah, very explicit. I mean, if you want the delivery role,

**Other:** **[20:26:13]** Is it posted?

**You:** **[20:26:14]** I'm sure like, that that I don't think I don't know. It's in Arrow Koala's role, but Sunny or not Manju. Reached out to me asking about who, like, I didn't really know who that was, but, I mean, if you want,

**Other:** **[20:26:32]** I'd be interested in reading it. Like,

**You:** **[20:26:34]** alright.

**Other:** **[20:26:36]** it'd probably be, like, a six month wait.

**You:** **[20:26:36]** I was just saying yeah. Because I think they

**Other:** **[20:26:41]** I'd love to leave, Clydes. And just be the we, like, also could go to a

**You:** **[20:26:45]** it would

**Other:** **[20:26:47]** client meeting and help someone out, like an account manager to talk about things. Like, could still be hybrid. But I would love Not that I'm unhappy in my current role, especially given all that just occurred in the last week.

**You:** **[20:26:59]** Right.

**Other:** **[20:27:01]** But I've I've constantly said, like, Zoey, should I just be the PM for this? Because I'm the only one who seems to get it.

**You:** **[20:27:05]** I know. Exactly.

**Other:** **[20:27:10]** Yeah. Okay.

**You:** **[20:27:12]** On. I'm
