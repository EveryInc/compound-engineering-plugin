# Create a plan for a new feature or bug fix

## Introduction

**Note: The current year is 2026.** Use this when dating plans and searching for recent documentation.

Transform feature descriptions, bug reports, or improvement ideas into well-structured markdown files issues that follow project conventions and best practices. This command provides flexible detail levels to match your needs.

## Feature Description

<feature_description> #$ARGUMENTS </feature_description>

**If the feature description above is empty, ask the user:** "What would you like to plan? Please describe the feature, bug fix, or improvement you have in mind."

Do not proceed until you have a clear feature description from the user.

### 0. Idea Refinement

Before running research, refine the idea through collaborative dialogue using the **AskUserQuestion tool**:

- Ask questions one at a time to understand the idea fully
- Prefer multiple choice questions when natural options exist
- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints and success criteria
- Continue until the idea is clear OR user says "proceed"

**Skip option:** If the feature description is already detailed, offer:
"Your description is clear. Should I proceed with research, or would you like to refine it further?"

## Main Tasks

### 1. Repository Research & Context Gathering

<thinking>
First, I need to understand the project's conventions and existing patterns, leveraging all available resources and use paralel subagents to do this.
</thinking>

Runn these three agents in paralel at the same time:

- Task repo-research-analyst(feature_description)
- Task best-practices-researcher(feature_description)
- Task framework-docs-researcher(feature_description)

**Reference Collection:**

- [ ] Document all research findings with specific file paths (e.g., `app/services/example_service.rb:42`)
- [ ] Include URLs to external documentation and best practices guides
- [ ] Create a reference list of similar issues or PRs (e.g., `#123`, `#456`)
- [ ] Note any team conventions discovered in `CLAUDE.md` or team documentation

### Research Validation (Optional)

After research agents complete, briefly validate alignment:

- Summarize key findings from research
- Ask if anything looks off or is missing
- User can confirm or request additional research on specific topics

### 2. Issue Planning & Structure

<thinking>
Think like a product manager - what would make this issue clear and actionable? Consider multiple perspectives
</thinking>

**Title & Categorization:**

- [ ] Draft clear, searchable issue title using conventional format (e.g., `feat: Add user authentication`, `fix: Cart total calculation`)
- [ ] Determine issue type: enhancement, bug, refactor
- [ ] Convert title to kebab-case filename: strip prefix colon, lowercase, hyphens for spaces
  - Example: `feat: Add User Authentication` → `feat-add-user-authentication.md`
  - Keep it descriptive (3-5 words after prefix) so plans are findable by context

**Stakeholder Analysis:**

- [ ] Identify who will be affected by this issue (end users, developers, operations)
- [ ] Consider implementation complexity and required expertise

**Content Planning:**

- [ ] Choose appropriate detail level based on issue complexity and audience
- [ ] List all necessary sections for the chosen template
- [ ] Gather supporting materials (error logs, screenshots, design mockups)
- [ ] Prepare code examples or reproduction steps if applicable, name the mock filenames in the lists

### 3. SpecFlow Analysis

After planning the issue structure, run SpecFlow Analyzer to validate and refine the feature specification:

- Task spec-flow-analyzer(feature_description, research_findings)

**SpecFlow Analyzer Output:**

- [ ] Review SpecFlow analysis results
- [ ] Incorporate any identified gaps or edge cases into the issue
- [ ] Update acceptance criteria based on SpecFlow findings

### 4. Choose Implementation Detail Level

Select how comprehensive you want the issue to be, simpler is mostly better.

### 5. Issue Creation & Formatting

<thinking>
Apply best practices for clarity and actionability, making the issue easy to scan and understand
</thinking>

**Content Formatting:**

- [ ] Use clear, descriptive headings with proper hierarchy (##, ###)
- [ ] Include code examples in triple backticks with language syntax highlighting
- [ ] Add screenshots/mockups if UI-related (drag & drop or use image hosting)
- [ ] Use task lists (- [ ]) for trackable items that can be checked off
- [ ] Add collapsible sections for lengthy logs or optional details using `<details>` tags
- [ ] Apply appropriate emoji for visual scanning (🐛 bug, ✨ feature, 📚 docs, ♻️ refactor)

**Cross-Referencing:**

- [ ] Link to related issues/PRs using #number format
- [ ] Reference specific commits with SHA hashes when relevant
- [ ] Link to code using GitHub's permalink feature (press 'y' for permanent link)
- [ ] Mention relevant team members with @username if needed
- [ ] Add links to external resources with descriptive text

**Code & Examples:**

````markdown
# Good example with syntax highlighting and line references


```ruby
# app/services/user_service.rb:42
def process_user(user)

# Implementation here

end
```

# Collapsible error logs

<details>
<summary>Full error stacktrace</summary>

`Error details here...`

</details>
````

**AI-Era Considerations:**

- [ ] Account for accelerated development with AI pair programming
- [ ] Include prompts or instructions that worked well during research
- [ ] Note which AI tools were used for initial exploration (Claude, Copilot, etc.)
- [ ] Emphasize comprehensive testing given rapid implementation
- [ ] Document any AI-generated code that needs human review

### 6. Final Review & Submission

**Pre-submission Checklist:**

- [ ] Title is searchable and descriptive
- [ ] Labels accurately categorize the issue
- [ ] All template sections are complete
- [ ] Links and references are working
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are measurable
- [ ] Add names of files in pseudo code examples and todo lists
- [ ] Add an ERD mermaid diagram if applicable for new model changes

## Output Format

**Filename:** Use the kebab-case filename from Step 2 Title & Categorization.

```
plans/<type>-<descriptive-name>.md
```

Examples:
- ✅ `plans/feat-user-authentication-flow.md`
- ✅ `plans/fix-checkout-race-condition.md`
- ✅ `plans/refactor-api-client-extraction.md`
- ❌ `plans/plan-1.md` (not descriptive)
- ❌ `plans/new-feature.md` (too vague)
- ❌ `plans/feat: user auth.md` (invalid characters)

## Post-Generation Options

After writing the plan file, use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to present these options:

**Question:** "Plan ready at `plans/<issue_title>.md`. What would you like to do next?"

**Options:**
1. **Open plan in editor** - Open the plan file for review
2. **Run `/deepen-plan`** - Enhance each section with parallel research agents (best practices, performance, UI)
3. **Run `/plan_review`** - Get feedback from reviewers (DHH, Kieran, Simplicity)
4. **Start `/workflows:work`** - Begin implementing this plan locally
5. **Start `/workflows:work` on remote** - Begin implementing in Claude Code on the web (use `&` to run in background)
6. **Create Issue** - Create issue in project tracker (GitHub/Linear)
7. **Simplify** - Reduce detail level

Based on selection:
- **Open plan in editor** → Run `open plans/<issue_title>.md` to open the file in the user's default editor
- **`/deepen-plan`** → Call the /deepen-plan command with the plan file path to enhance with research
- **`/plan_review`** → Call the /plan_review command with the plan file path
- **`/workflows:work`** → Call the /workflows:work command with the plan file path
- **`/workflows:work` on remote** → Run `/workflows:work plans/<issue_title>.md &` to start work in background for Claude Code web
- **Create Issue** → See "Issue Creation" section below
- **Simplify** → Ask "What should I simplify?" then regenerate simpler version
- **Other** (automatically provided) → Accept free text for rework or specific changes

**Note:** If running `/workflows:plan` with ultrathink enabled, automatically run `/deepen-plan` after plan creation for maximum depth and grounding.

Loop back to options after Simplify or Other changes until user selects `/workflows:work` or `/plan_review`.

## Issue Creation

When user selects "Create Issue", detect their project tracker from CLAUDE.md:

1. **Check for tracker preference** in user's CLAUDE.md (global or project):
   - Look for `project_tracker: github` or `project_tracker: linear`
   - Or look for mentions of "GitHub Issues" or "Linear" in their workflow section

2. **If GitHub:**
   ```bash
   # Extract title from plan filename (kebab-case to Title Case)
   # Read plan content for body
   gh issue create --title "feat: [Plan Title]" --body-file plans/<issue_title>.md
   ```

3. **If Linear:**
   ```bash
   # Use linear CLI if available, or provide instructions
   # linear issue create --title "[Plan Title]" --description "$(cat plans/<issue_title>.md)"
   ```

4. **If no tracker configured:**
   Ask user: "Which project tracker do you use? (GitHub/Linear/Other)"
   - Suggest adding `project_tracker: github` or `project_tracker: linear` to their CLAUDE.md

5. **After creation:**
   - Display the issue URL
   - Ask if they want to proceed to `/workflows:work` or `/plan_review`

NEVER CODE! Just research and write the plan.
