# Opt-in stack construction and submit recipes

Load this file only when commit-push-pr stack mode is active (user intent or standing preference wants a PR stack). Soft-depend on the `gh stack` CLI — never hard-depend on an external gh-stack skill package.

This reference has two lifecycle phases. Before ordinary Step 3, run Probe, Topology, and, when needed, Retrospective construction only; do not run Submit. Step 5, after Step 4 has composed the PR titles and bodies, is the only phase that runs Submit.

## Probe

```bash
command -v gh
gh stack view --json
```

If `gh` or `gh stack` is missing, or the stack command exits unavailable for this repo (rather than merely reporting that the current branch is not part of a stack), stop with a clear residual. Stack intent is **required** when the user explicitly demanded a multi-PR stack or standing preference forces stacks → hard-stop. Otherwise intent is **soft** → residual + fall back to ordinary single-PR create.

## Topology

When `gh stack view --json` confirms the current branch belongs to a managed stack, preserve that topology. If no topology exists, use retrospective construction below. If the complete work is one logical change or only artificial slices are possible, refuse the stack and use the single-PR path.

Any explicit new upstack branch the user already directed must base from the **authoritative parent tip** after fetch: prefer `<tracking-remote>/<parent>` when that remote tip is current for the confirmed stack layer; if the parent’s latest work is only local (not yet on the tracking remote — common before the first `gh stack submit`), base from the local parent branch instead. Create with `git checkout -b -- "<branch-name>" "<parent-tip>"` (stash/pop only if uncommitted changes would block checkout). For an **upstack** layer, do **not** follow `references/branch-creation.md` — that reference’s `origin/<base>` flow would detach the layer from its parent. Do not hard-code `origin/<parent>` when the tracking remote differs or the remote tip lags the local parent.

## Retrospective construction

Before ordinary Step 3, inspect the **complete change set** against the resolved base: existing commits plus tracked, staged, and untracked working changes. Derive the **smallest useful set of linear, independently reviewable layers** in dependency order, foundation first. Each layer must be coherent against its parent and must not depend on an upstack layer. Use whole-file groups or existing commit boundaries; never use `git add -p` to force a split.

When one safe topology is clear, proceed without asking: explicit stack intent authorizes the necessary local branches and commits. When multiple reasonable topologies would materially change review boundaries, ask the user with a concise bottom-to-top proposal. In `mode:pipeline`, stop with that proposal as a residual instead of guessing. If the split requires hunk-level partitioning or rewriting published history, ask the user before proceeding in interactive mode. In `mode:pipeline`, do not split or rewrite; stop with a residual that describes the required partition or rewrite and the explicit confirmation needed to proceed. Never rewrite published history without explicit confirmation.

For a new bottom layer, first follow `references/branch-creation.md` to fetch and resolve its safe base, including the unpushed-local-commit decision and stash protection. That reference applies only to the bottom branch; every upstack layer starts from its immediate parent through `gh stack add`.

For uncommitted whole-file groups, initialize or adopt the bottom layer, commit only its files, then add and commit each next layer in order:

```bash
gh stack init --base "<base>" "<bottom-branch>"
git add <bottom-files> && git commit -m "<bottom-message>"
gh stack add "<next-branch>"
git add <next-files> && git commit -m "<next-message>"
```

For committed work whose existing commit boundaries already match the plan, create or reuse one branch at each layer tip and adopt them bottom-to-top with `gh stack init --base "<base>" "<bottom-branch>" "<next-branch>" ...`. If unpublished commits need rearrangement, keep a recovery branch at the original tip before rewriting. After construction, run `gh stack view --json`; verify the reported order matches the plan and the top layer contains the complete original change set before submit.

## Submit (ready / non-draft)

Before submit, inspect the manager's open PRs (`gh stack view --json` / `gh pr view`) for any **existing draft** layers. If any draft already exists that the author did not explicitly ask to open this run, do **not** pass `--open` (GitHub documents `--open` as also marking existing PRs ready for review). In that case: submit with `gh stack submit --auto` only, then treat remaining drafts as a hard residual before babysit when babysit is on — never auto-ready WIP drafts.

When no existing drafts are present (or the user explicitly authorized opening every layer):

```bash
gh stack submit --auto --open
```

`--auto` alone creates drafts; babysit skips drafts by default. Draft-only outcomes are a hard residual / reopen step before babysit handoff when babysit is on — never treat drafts as successful stack-ship completion.

Reuse ordinary PR description guidance for titles/bodies after submit (`gh pr edit` as needed). Do not invent stack-specific auto-title quality improvements in this skill.

## Forbidden on managed members

```bash
gh pr merge …
```

Landing uses `gh stack merge` only (owned by babysit under `posture:stack-land`, or the user).
