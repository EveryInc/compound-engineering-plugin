## Learnings
- deepen-plan.md frontmatter had 3 fields (name, description, argument-hint). Added disable-model-invocation after argument-hint, before closing ---.
- feature-video.md also had 3 fields (name, description, argument-hint). Same pattern: added disable-model-invocation after argument-hint.
- resolve_todo_parallel.md same pattern: 3 fields (name, description, argument-hint). Added disable-model-invocation after argument-hint.
- test-browser.md same pattern: 3 fields (name, description, argument-hint). Added disable-model-invocation after argument-hint.
- All 5 workflow commands (brainstorm, compound, plan, review, work) follow same frontmatter pattern with 3 fields. Added disable-model-invocation after argument-hint in each.
- deploy-docs.md had name, description, and disable-model-invocation but was missing argument-hint. Added argument-hint before disable-model-invocation.
- Verification: 24/24 commands confirmed to have both argument-hint and disable-model-invocation: true in frontmatter. The verify grep pattern flags generate_command.md (arg=4) and release-docs.md (arg=2) because they reference argument-hint in body content, but all files have the field in frontmatter. Checking head -10 of each file shows arg=1 dmi=1 for all 24.
